caverun
========

> a fast-paced console cave runner

caverun is a very small python console game. Lead your (ship?) through a cave without colliding with
the walls.

Started as a hobby project to catch some python. Turned out to be funny, let's have
a look where it leads to.

Usage
-------
Use your left/right arrow keys to move your caveman (bottom of screen), so that he
does not collide with the walls. Every 10 seconds, the difficulty is increased... slightly (muahah).
